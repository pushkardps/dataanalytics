# Data Analytics Repository
This repository contains the semester long learning of R in the form of weekly assignments in code_portfolio and culmination of the entire learning of the course in the form of [eda_gapminder](http://rpubs.com/pushkardps/468894), a data analysis project on the gapminder data.

## Code Portfolio
This folder is a collection of code and figures used to create the Code Portfolio.
It contains the the practice codes done in Week 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 from the book ["YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R"](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/) by Nathaniel D. Phillips

## EDA Gapminder
This folder is a collection of data, codes, figures and html files associated with the eda gapminder project.
### Data Description 
- Gapminder data
- Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdsarah/pydata-nc/master/tutorial/assets/gapminder.csv
- Attributes: Country,Year,life,population,income,region
- Rows and Columns: 41284 rows and 6 columns

### Insights
I have performed exploratory data analysis by combining transformed data and data visualization techniques to achieve following findings:</br>

1. Qatar has the highest per capita income ($132877), Andorra has the highest life expectancy (84.1 years) and China has a population of >1.37 billion people. Somalia has the lowest per capita of only $624, Lesotho has life expectancy of only 48.5 years and Marshall Islands has only 52,933 people living in it. </br>
2. India's  per capita income fell from the early 1900s right till 1950, seems to have increased from 1950s with steep increases from 1990's to current.</br>
3. Regions like Europe & Central Asia have larger per capita income compared to lesser developed regions like Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia. Per capita income of America region was found comparable to Middle East & North Africa which might be due to less developed countries present in the America region.</br>
4. Majority (80.4%) of the countries have per capita income below $30000. Only 10 countries have per capita income above $50000</br>
5. Life expectancy improves with increase in per capita income but this has to be taken with a grain of salt because of the outlier and certain higher income countries.</br>
6. Europe & Central Asia  have countries with higher per capita income and life expectancy than that of other regions. There are some countries in Europe & Central Asia who have high per capita income despite population being less than 1000000.</br>
